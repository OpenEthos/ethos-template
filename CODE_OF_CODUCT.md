# **Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct**

## **Our Pledge**

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## **Our Standards**

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.  
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.  
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.  
* Focusing on what is best for the community.  
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.  
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.  
* Public or private harassment.  
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## **Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting through an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## **Enforcement Responsibilities**

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## **Reporting Guidelines**

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it immediately by contacting the project team at **[jason.miller@thoughtparameters.com](mailto:jason.miller@thoughtparameters.com)**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
