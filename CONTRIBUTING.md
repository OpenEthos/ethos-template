# **Contributing to OpenEthos**

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute\! Your involvement is what makes the OpenEthos framework robust, secure, and truly open. We appreciate all forms of contributionâ€”from code and documentation to bug reports and community support.

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## **1\. Ways to Contribute**

There are many valuable ways to help the OpenEthos project:

* **Code**: Submit pull requests for bug fixes, new features, or performance enhancements in the core engine, agents, or APIs.  
* **Documentation**: Improve our guides, tutorials, installation instructions, and API references (in the ethos-docs repository).  
* **Policy Content**: Contribute new policy sets (e.g., CIS benchmarks for new services) or refine existing ones (in the ethos-policies repository).  
* **Report Issues**: Report bugs or suggest feature ideas using the GitHub Issues tracker.

## **2\. Getting Started**

### **2.1 Reporting Bugs**

If you find a bug in any OpenEthos component (e.g., ethos-engine, ethos-agent-aws, ethos-cli), please use the GitHub Issues tracker of the relevant repository.

* **Search First**: Check the existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported.  
* **Clarity**: Provide a clear, descriptive title.  
* **Steps to Reproduce**: Detail the exact steps and environment configuration needed to reproduce the issue.  
* **Expected vs. Actual**: Clearly describe what you expected to happen and what actually happened.  
* **Environment**: Include version information for the component and the operating system/cloud service involved.

### **2.2 Suggesting Enhancements**

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement:

* **Use GitHub Discussions**: We prefer feature discussions to start in the main organization's **Discussions** tab under a "Feature Ideas" category to gather community feedback before committing to implementation.  
* **Scope**: Clearly define the scope and purpose of the enhancement. Explain the problem it solves and why it's important for the OpenEthos mission.

## **3\. Pull Request (PR) Workflow**

For code and documentation contributions, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository (e.g., OpenEthos/ethos-engine) to your personal GitHub account.  
2. **Clone** your fork locally:  
   git clone git@github.com:\<YourUserName\>/ethos-engine.git

3. **Create a New Branch**: Base your work off the main branch.  
   git checkout \-b feature/my-new-agent-check  
   \# OR  
   git checkout \-b fix/auth-bug-in-api

4. **Implement Changes**: Write your code, update documentation, or modify policy files.  
5. **Test**: Add or update unit and integration tests to cover your changes. All continuous integration (CI) tests must pass.  
6. **Commit**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages. We use the conventional commit specification (e.g., fix(agent): Corrected AWS S3 bucket naming validation).  
7. **Push** your changes to your fork.  
8. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit a PR from your branch to the main branch of the original OpenEthos repository.

## **4\. Pull Request Standards**

To ensure a smooth review process, please adhere to these standards:

* **One Feature/Fix Per PR**: Keep your PR focused on a single logical change. Larger features should be broken down into smaller, manageable pull requests.  
* **Testing**: New features **must** include tests. Bug fixes **should** include a regression test to prevent the issue from recurring.  
* **Documentation**: If you change functionality, you must update the associated documentation (code comments, README.md, or the ethos-docs repository if applicable).  
* **Clear Description**: Fill out the PR template completely, explaining the *what* and *why* of your changes.

## **5\. Coding Style and Conventions**

Consistency is key for maintainability.

* **Language Standards**: Adhere to the idiomatic style for the repository's language (e.g., go fmt for Go, standard linters for Python).  
* **Readability**: Prioritize clean, readable, and well-commented code.  
* **Dependencies**: Minimize the introduction of new external dependencies. Any new dependency must be thoroughly justified.

## **6\. License**

By submitting a Pull Request, you assert that:

* You are submitting your work under the same [LICENSE](LICENSE) that is used by the OpenEthos project.  
* You have the right to contribute the code under this license.

We look forward to collaborating with you\!
